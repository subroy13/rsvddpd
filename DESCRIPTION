Description: Computing singular value decomposition with robustness is a challenging task. 
    This package provides an implementation of computing robust SVD using density power 
    divergence (<arXiv:2109.10680>). It combines the idea of robustness and efficiency in estimation
    based on a tuning parameter. It also provides utility functions to simulate various
    scenarios to compare performances of different algorithms.
